                    Here at review.com we specialize in creating a communication channel between customer and company, making sure both parties can continue to improve on the quality of life of both parties.</p>
                <p>
                    Apart from out online precence and service, we also offer a variety of ways to help restuarants and bakeries make sure we reach their customers, this can be with the help of custom stickers to put on boxes or custom napkins to service with the food.</p>
                <p>
                    Each restaurant gets a special code that will only let the customer reivew thier specific restuarant, and also helps prevent spam and fake reivews. Apart from this rudementary system we also have AI and human personel analysing data and making sure that
                    there are no harrasment reviews being sent out to hurt businesses.</p>
                <p>
                    It is also important to notice that none of the data sent by customers ever reach other customers. This point of review.com is for businesses to understand what different customers wants and needs, not for customers to go to review.com and see what other
                    people thought of a specific restuarant. We're not competing with google.</p>
